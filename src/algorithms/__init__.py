"""Graph Algorithms Module

Components:
- louvain: Community detection (resolution Î³=1.0)
- forceatlas2: Graph layout algorithm
- betweenness: Brandes' betweenness centrality (normalized 0-1)
- modularity: Newman-Girvan weighted modularity calculator

All algorithms use EXACT parameters from research specifications.
