---

## Blockers

**None currently.** Phase 0 is 100% complete. Ready to begin Phase 1.

---

## Notes

- ✅ Using "Synthesis" as project name

- ✅ NO approximations or deviations
- ✅ Repository structure matches instructions 100%

## Validation Rules

Before marking any phase complete:
1. All deliverables checked off
2. Tests passing (100%)
3. Spec validator shows 100% compliance
4. Code committed to GitHub
5. PROGRESS.md updated
