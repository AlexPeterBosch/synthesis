## SECTION 1: TEXT PROCESSING & NLP

### Q1: What is the exact English stopwords list?

**Answer:** 180+ word custom stopwords list based on Snowball stemmer with extensions.

**Complete List:**
```
a, an, the, i, me, my, myself, we, our, ours, ourselves, you, your, yours,
yourself, yourselves, he, him, his, himself, she, her, hers, herself, it,
its, itself, they, them, their, theirs, themselves, is, are, was, were,
be, been, being, have, has, had, do, does, did, doesn't, will, would,
should, could, may, might, must, can, cannot, can't, of, at, by, for,
with, about, against, between, into, through, during, before, after,
above, below, to, from, up, down, in, out, on, off, over, under, again,
further, then, once, here, there, when, where, why, how, all, both, each,
few, more, most, other, some, such, no, nor, not, only, own, same, so,
than, too, very, and, but, or, because, as, until, while, necessary,
really, just, quite, rather, actually, basically, thing, things,
something, anything, everything, nothing
```

**User Customization:**
- Add: "jan, feb, mar" for date removal
- Remove: "-did, -do" to include specific words
- Can be disabled entirely

### Q2: What lemmatization algorithm is used?

**Answer:** spaCy dictionary-based lemmatization (en_core_web_sm for English)

**Process:**
1. Input: "companies researching innovative laboratories"
2. After stopwords: "companies researching innovative laboratories"
3. After lemmatization: "company research innovative laboratory"

**Technical Details:**
- Uses morphological rules (not suffix stripping)
- Handles irregular forms ("was" → "be")
- Language-specific models available

**Processing Order (CRITICAL):**
1. Tokenization
2. Special character removal  
3. **Stopwords removal** ← FIRST
4. **Lemmatization** ← SECOND
5. N-gram extraction

### Q3: How does Named Entity Recognition work?

**Answer:** Three-mode NER system for flexibility

**Mode 1: Lemmas Only (Default)**
- No entity extraction
- Pure word-level lemmatization
- Dense graphs with maximum detail

**Mode 2: Mixed Mode**
- Preserves multi-word entities ("New York")
- Single words lemmatized
- Balanced approach

**Mode 3: Entities Only**  
- Extracts named entities
- Uses canonical root form
- Cleaner, entity-focused graphs

**Entity Types Recognized:**
- PERSON, ORG, GPE, LOC, PRODUCT, EVENT, DATE, etc.

### Q4: What is the exact n-gram extraction algorithm?

**Answer:** TWO-PASS 4-gram window with distance-based weights

**Pass 1: Bigrams (adjacent words)**
```python
for i in range(len(tokens) - 1):
    ngram(tokens[i], tokens[i+1], weight=3)
```

**Pass 2: 4-gram window**
```python
for i in range(len(tokens) - 3):
    window = tokens[i:i+4]
    
    # Distance 1 (1 word apart) → weight = 2
    ngram(window[0], window[2], weight=2)
    ngram(window[1], window[3], weight=2)
    
    # Distance 2 (2 words apart) → weight = 1
    ngram(window[0], window[3], weight=1)
```

**CRITICAL:** Paragraph breaks (\n\n) STOP scanning!

**Example:**
```
Input: "AI tools analyze customer feedback"
Tokens: ["ai", "tool", "analyze", "customer", "feedback"]

Pass 1 (weight=3):
- ai → tool
- tool → analyze
- analyze → customer
- customer → feedback

Pass 2 (weight=2):
- ai → analyze
- tool → customer
- analyze → feedback

Pass 2 (weight=1):
- ai → customer
- tool → feedback
```

### Q5: How are paragraph breaks handled?

**Answer:** Double newlines (\n\n) act as HARD BOUNDARIES

**Algorithm:**
```python
paragraphs = text.split('\n\n')
for paragraph in paragraphs:
    tokens = process_paragraph(paragraph)
    ngrams = extract_ngrams(tokens)  # Does NOT cross paragraph
```

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents spurious connections between unrelated topics
- Preserves semantic boundaries
- More accurate graph structure

## SECTION 2: GRAPH CONSTRUCTION

### Q6: How are edge weights calculated?

**Answer:** ADDITIVE accumulation WITHOUT normalization

**Formula:**
```python
edge_weight[source][target] = sum(all co-occurrence weights)
```

**Example:**
If "research" and "laboratory" appear:
- 5 times as bigrams (adjacent): 3+3+3+3+3 = 15
- 3 times with 1 word between: 2+2+2 = 6
- 2 times with 2 words apart: 1+1 = 2

**Final edge weight: 15 + 6 + 2 = 23**

**NO normalization is applied at any stage**

### Q7: What is the database schema?

**Answer:** PostgreSQL with 6 core tables

**Tables:**
1. **users** - User accounts
2. **contexts** - Graph instances (@private, @public, etc.)
3. **nodes** - All node types with JSONB properties
4. **edges** - Weighted connections
5. **statements** - Original text segments
6. **graph_metrics** - Calculated metrics

**Critical Indexes:**
- GIN index on nodes.properties (JSONB)
- Composite index on edges(source_node_id, target_node_id)
- Index on edge weights for filtering

### Q8: What node types exist?

**Answer:** 5 node types with different purposes

1. **concept** - Lemmatized words/entities (majority)
2. **statement** - Text segments  
3. **context** - Graph containers
4. **user** - User nodes
5. **narrative** - Storyline nodes

**Relationship Types (7):**
- :TO (standard connection)
- :AT (location/time)
- :OF (possession/composition)
- :IN (containment)
- :BY (authorship)
- :INTO (transformation)
- :THRU (passage)

## SECTION 3: ALGORITHMS

### Q9: Which community detection algorithm is used?

**Answer:** Louvain algorithm with default resolution γ=1.0

**Parameters:**
```python
resolution = 1.0  # Default
weighted = True   # Uses edge weights
stopping_criteria = ΔQ < 0.0001
```

**Process:**
1. Start with each node in own community
2. Move nodes to maximize modularity gain
3. Aggregate communities into super-nodes
4. Repeat until convergence

### Q10: What is the exact modularity formula?

**Answer:** Newman-Girvan weighted modularity

**Formula:**
```
Q = 1/(2m) Σ [Aᵢⱼ - (kᵢkⱼ)/(2m)] δ(cᵢ,cⱼ)

Where:
- m = total edge weight
- Aᵢⱼ = edge weight between i and j
- kᵢ = sum of weights connected to node i
- δ(cᵢ,cⱼ) = 1 if i and j in same community, else 0
```

**Thresholds:**
- Q < 0.4 → Weak structure (too interconnected)
- 0.4 ≤ Q ≤ 0.7 → Strong structure ✓
- Q > 0.7 → Very strong (possibly disconnected)

### Q11: Which layout algorithm is used?

**Answer:** ForceAtlas2 with Barnes-Hut optimization

**Parameters:**
```python
gravity = 1.0
scalingRatio = 20.0
strongGravityMode = True
linLogMode = False
edgeWeightInfluence = 1.0
barnesHutOptimize = True
barnesHutTheta = 1.2
jitterTolerance = 1.0
```

**Iteration Count:**
- Small graphs (<500 nodes): 500-1000 iterations
- Large graphs (>500 nodes): 1000-2000 iterations

### Q12: How is betweenness centrality calculated?

**Answer:** Brandes' algorithm with normalization

**Algorithm:** Brandes (2001) - O(n·m) complexity

**Normalization:**
```python
# Undirected graph
bc_normalized = bc_raw / [(n-1)(n-2)/2]

# Range: 0 to 1
```

**Usage:**
- Determines node importance
- Used for node sizing (5-40 pixels)
- Identifies "bridge" concepts

---

## SECTION 4: VISUALIZATION

### Q13: How are node sizes calculated?

**Answer:** LINEAR scaling based on betweenness (NOT logarithmic)

**Formula:**
```python
min_size = 5   # pixels
max_size = 40  # pixels

size = 5 + (bc_normalized * 35)

# Ratio: 8:1 (max/min)
```

**Example:**
- Node with BC=0.0 → size = 5px
- Node with BC=0.5 → size = 22.5px  
- Node with BC=1.0 → size = 40px

### Q14: Which nodes show labels?

**Answer:** Only nodes with size > 20 pixels (~top 30%)

**Logic:**
```javascript
labelThreshold = 20  // pixels
showLabel = node.size > labelThreshold
```

**Why:** Prevents visual clutter on dense graphs

### Q15: How is edge thickness calculated?

**Answer:** Logarithmic scale based on weight

**Formula:**
```javascript
thickness = log(weight + 1)
```

**Example:**
- weight=1 → thickness = 0.69
- weight=5 → thickness = 1.79
- weight=20 → thickness = 3.04

### Q16: What visualization library is used?

**Answer:** Sigma.js v2 (WebGL renderer) with Graphology

**Stack:**
- **Sigma.js** - WebGL-based graph rendering
- **Graphology** - Graph data structure
- **React** - UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling

**Performance:**

**Definition:**
Two communities with:
- High internal density
- Low inter-community connections  
- Moderate path length (2-6 hops)
- Semantic relevance

### Q18: What is the gap detection algorithm?

**Answer:** Five-stage filtering process

**Stage 1: Size Filters**
```python
MIN_COMMUNITY_SIZE = 3  # nodes
MAX_SIZE_RATIO = 10     # 10:1 maximum
```

**Stage 2: Distance Filters**
```python
MIN_PATH_LENGTH = 2  # hops
MAX_PATH_LENGTH = 6  # hops
```

**Stage 3: Density Filters**
```python
DENSITY_THRESHOLD = 0.1  # 10% or less
```

**Stage 4: Gap Score Calculation**
```python
gap_score = (size_a × size_b × (1/distance)) / (connections + 1)
```

**Stage 5: Semantic Validation**
- Use AI to validate relevance
- Filter out spurious gaps

**Output:** Top 3 gaps with highest scores (minimum 0.4)

### Q19: How many gaps are typically returned?

**Answer:** Maximum 3 gaps per query

**Reasoning:**
- Focus on most impactful connections

    # Find nodes matching query
    seed_nodes = find_matching_nodes(query_keywords)
    
    # Get 2-hop neighborhood
    subgraph_nodes = set()
    for seed in seed_nodes:
        subgraph_nodes.add(seed)
        subgraph_nodes.update(graph.neighbors(seed))  # 1-hop
        for neighbor in graph.neighbors(seed):
